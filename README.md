# [Go Live With WebRTC][published url]
## Instructor: [Reggie Dawson][instructor url]


WebRTC is a new standard that provides web and mobile apps with Real-Time Communications (RTC) with a simple API. WebRTC makes it easy to deliver streaming video and audio communications to the browser and mobile platforms.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Reggie Dawson will teach you how to use WebRTC to  to enable audio, vidoe, and data communications in the browser. Along the way, you'll use the WebRTC API to build a series of simple apps that demonstrate video streaming with webcams and data channels. You'll also learn how to use key WebRTC signaling protocols such as ICE, STUN and TURN.
